How has Map Kibera and OSM had a community impact even as drones, satellite technology and AI are revolutionizing mapping? What has changed, and what has remained the same?

Applied to cities like Turin, Tel Aviv, and San Francisco, this approach effectively streamlined pedestrian and bicycle networks.
