<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='kenya'>Kenya</h2>

Kenya is a vibrant and diverse East African nation with beautiful landscapes and rich cultures. The country, nestled on the equator, has amazing infrastructure, and its citizens are welcoming and friendly.

<h3>Languages</h3>

Kenya is a multi-ethnic State with a variety of languages spoken. English is the official language, while Kiswahili is the national and widely spoken language. In Nairobi, most people communicate in English and Swahili. A vast group of younger generations use slang commonly referred to as sheng, a mixture of various local dialects, including English and Swahili.

<h3>Time Zone</h3>

Kenya is within the East Africa Standard Time zone. It is three hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT +3).

<h3>Weather</h3>

Kenya enjoys a tropical climate that is pleasant, favourable, and characterised by plenty of sunshine all year round. In September, the temperature ranges from an average high of 24.6°C (76.3°F) to an average low of 14.2°C (57.6°F). The climate of inland cities, such as Nairobi, is temperate. It is recommended to prepare for dry and rainy days and to check the weather before travelling.


<h3 id='nairobi'>Nairobi</h3>

Nairobi is Kenya's capital and largest city, with an estimated population of 5,325,160 as of 2023. It serves as the country's economic, political, and cultural heart. The metropolis is located in the south-central part of Kenya and is the biggest city in Eastern Africa, making it a very ethnically and culturally diverse city where all the major ethnic tribes reside, besides Asians, Europeans, and expatriates. It also serves as the entry point to many African countries.

Nairobi is a hub for many international organisations and a gateway to some of Africa's most renowned national parks and wildlife reserves. The city has cultural attractions like museums, art galleries, and vibrant street markets. Visitors can savour a wide range of cuisines from both local and international food chains. Whether you are interested in history, wildlife, or shopping, Nairobi is the city.

The city has successfully hosted some major conferences, including Africa Climate Summit  (2023), UN Environment Assembly 5 (2022), RCMRD International Conference (2023), amongst many other regional and global events.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='conference-venue'>Venue</h2>

State of the Map 2024 will be hosted at the [University of Nairobi](https://www.uonbi.ac.ke/). It is a globally recognised world-class institution funded by the Kenyan government.

The conference will take place on the main campus at the University of Nairobi Towers, located [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=-1.27907&mlon=36.81635).

<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='moving-around'>Moving around Nairobi</h2>

<h3>Taxi Services</h3>

Reliable Online and traditional cab/taxi operators are available within the city, offering reliable and affordable services. Payment can be made in local currency or using the known global currency. We recommend using online services via [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ke/en/) or the Kenyan service [Little Cab](https://www.little.bz/) while in Nairobi. And if your plane arrives a bit late, or you need to get to the airport at an odd hour, this option also allows for booking taxis: [PTG Travel](https://www.ptgtravels.com/). Lastly, most hotels also offer transit services that can be used for both airport transfers and movement around Nairobi. For security reasons, we advise that you **do not use** Bolt at this time.

Whereas tipping the taxi driver is customary for good service, it is not mandatory. Do not feel obligated, and neither should the taxi/cab driver force you to tip them.

Nairobi only has one toll road - the [Nairobi Expressway](https://nairobiexpressway.ke/nairobi-expressway-toll-rates) connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Westlands area. While it's a faster option with scenic views when coming and going to the airport, its costs are not included in your cab/taxi fees. Depending on your entry and exit points, this amount ranges from KES 170 to KES 500. The exact amount to be paid is displayed on a screen and can be paid by cash or mobile money.


<h3>Public Transport</h3>

Nairobi City has a diverse public transport system linking the Central Business District to several areas across the metropolitan area. Integrated with a few government-operated public transportation like trains and some bus companies, the public transport is dominated by ‘Matatus’ (basic 14-seater vans and 27-seater buses). Non-citizen guests are not recommended to use matatus unless they are accompanied by a local guide.

<h3>Motorbikes</h3>

In Nairobi, motorbikes, commonly referred to as 'boda-bodas,' are a popular and convenient mode of transportation. They can navigate through traffic more quickly than cars and are often used for quick trips around the city. If you would like to use a motorbike, It's important to exercise caution. Always use reputable services from ride-hailing apps like Uber that offer motorbike options and have safety measures in place. While convenient, please note that motorbike taxis may not be suitable for long distances or those with mobility challenges.

<h3>Telephone Services</h3>

Mobile telephone services are quite efficient in Kenya. Some of the leading providers are Safaricom, Airtel, and Telkom, which offer voice, data, messaging, mobile money services, and access to up to 5G internet coverage. 

While there will be WiFi coverage at the conference venue and in locations like hotels and malls, we recommend participants to purchase and register Safaricom SIM cards (available at the airport and malls) at approximately KES. 140(This does not include costs for a data bundle). 

<h3>Payments</h3>

Online payments (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.) are accepted by most establishments in Kenya. We recommend requesting to tap your card and not allowing a service provider to walk away with it at any point.

<h3>Banking Services</h3>

Business hours are generally from 0830hrs to 1600hrs on weekdays and from 0830hrs to 1200hrs on Saturdays. The banks remain closed on Sundays and public holidays. Most banks have 24-hour Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) accepting international debit and credit cards. 

<h3>Foreign Exchange</h3>

Foreign currencies can be exchanged at the banks and Forex Bureaus. The currency of Kenya is the Shilling (KES) and is issued in 1000, 500, 200, 100 and 50 banknotes and 40, 20, 10, 5 and 1 coins. Currency exchange points are available at banks, the airport and at major malls & hotels. The daily prevailing exchange rate of major international currencies can be obtained from the [Central Bank of Kenya website]https://www.centralbank.go.ke/rates/forex-exchange-rates/). 

<h3>Business and Shopping Hours</h3>

Most businesses are generally open from 0800hrs to 1700hrs. However, some shopping malls operate 24 hrs. Guests who wish to shop may seek advice from their hotels on the nearest shopping facilities. Guests can also shop online as supermarkets such as Carrefour and Naivas allow for the same all days of the week with deliveries upto 10 PM.

<h3>Restaurants and Other Hotel Services</h3>

Considering the central location of the host institution, there is a wide range of accommodation services, including hotels, serviced apartments(Airbnbs), and shared hostels. We recommend guests stay in hotels as services are guaranteed and security is assured. In addition, kindly go through reviews on booking and social media platforms.

African, Western and Oriental cuisines are all available in Nairobi restaurants. Additionally, guests can also order from popular restaurants online via Uber Eats and Little Cab. When dining in Nairobi, leaving a tip is voluntary and considered courteous.

The local organising committee [has shared](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/welcome-to-nairobi_1097859) a recommended list of hotels and restaurants for consideration.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='healthcare'>Public Healthcare</h2>

Nairobi is generally considered low-risk for malaria, particularly within the city limits. However, it's always wise to take basic precautions, such as using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing in the evenings, to minimise any risk of mosquito bites. Other health considerations include ensuring that routine vaccinations are up-to-date and practising good hygiene to prevent common illnesses. Should you experience any health issues or have concerns, the city’s public healthcare facilities are well-equipped to assist you. In case of health emergencies, we recommend visiting private health facilities which also accept comprehensive travel insurance covers. If one needs to purchase prescription medication, one can visit a pharmacy that are common across neighbourhoods and in malls. One can also place an order on [myDAWA](https://mydawa.com/) for delivery services.

Stay informed about any specific health advisories before travelling, and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your health during your stay.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='safety'>Personal Safety</h2>

Nairobi is a quite welcoming city in general, but not every corner is [safe](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/kenya/safety-and-security#crime): mugging, robbery and carjacking are frequent incidents. One should consider the company of a local person to visit most places around the city, especially Eastleigh, Central Business District, Mathare, Kibera and slum areas, as well as isolated areas in general. You might be at higher risk of attracting muggers if you appear to be in ownership of expensive items. Be vigilant at all times, but especially so around bus stations, railway stations and airports. Also be aware of thieves posing as police officers and private security guards.

**Should you get attacked, do not resist! In an emergency, contact the emergency services on 999 or 112.**

The conference will try to provide sufficient information about personal safety in Nairobi. Aditionally, local volunteers can give further advice, answer your questions and help.

LGBTQ community members are allowed to enter Kenya but it is important to mention that the nation is conservative when it comes to traditions and practices and therefore public showcasing of such related acts might expose one to public criticism. Kenyan law criminalizes same-sex sexual activity. Enforcement of the law is rare but restrained behaviour in public is nonetheless advised. LGBTQI+ advocacy organizations, such as the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya, do have been permitted to register and conduct activities. Please also consult the travel advisories of your home country before coming.



<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='getting-to'>Getting to Nairobi</h2>

<h3>Flights</h3>

Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA)  is an international airport serving Nairobi and Africa’s premier hub and ideal gateway into and out of East and Central Africa. The airport is situated 18km from the central business district and is the largest and busiest aviation facility in East Africa. It is the hub of Kenya Airways, the national flag carrier, Jambojet, and serves over 40 passenger airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, RwandAir. Alternative international aviation facilities are Kisumu International Airport, Eldoret International Airport, and Moi International Airport in Mombasa, with the rest spread across Kenyan regions.

Note that single-use plastic bags are prohibited in Kenya. If you
are travelling to Kenya, single use plastic bags will be confiscated at the airport. Please consider using alternative such as reusable bags instead.

<h3>Bus Travel Within East and Southern Africa</h3>

Road transport is commonly used within East African countries on a daily basis because of the good road infrastructure, security, and cost effectiveness. The recent infrastructural developments and easened custom borders process have made bus travelling easier in other neighbouring regions of south and central Africa.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='visa'>Visa</h2>

Kenya as a country is such a welcoming state with open borders for most countries worldwide. In early 2024, there have been some changes in the Visa [requirement](https://immigration.ecitizen.go.ke/index.php?id=6) and [aquisition process](https://immigration.go.ke/border-management/arrival-procedures-and-the-responsibility-of-travelers-on-arrival/) for Kenya: Foreign citizens are allowed entry into Kenya once they acquire an electronic travel authorization (ETA / eVisa). Citizens of [East Africa Community](https://www.eac.int/) member states are exempt from this requirement.

To obtain a Visa to visit Kenya, one needs a valid passport and a Yellow fever vaccination certificate, as required by the government [ministry of health](https://health.go.ke/incoming-travellers). The eVisa can be acquired through the [online platform](https://evisa.go.ke). The eVisa should be made available between 2- 14 days after application and making the necessary payment. NB: Visas can also be acquired on arrival at the airport.

If you would like to get an invitation letter from the conference organization comittee for your visa application process, please contact us at [sotm@openstreetmap.org](mailto:sotm@openstreetmap.org) with your details.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='accommodation'>Accommodation</h2>

Considering the central location of the host institution, there is a wide range of accommodation services ranging from hotels, Airbnbs, and shared hostels, all with a huge range of amenities including swimming pools, rooftop restaurants, spa and health club and airport shuttle. All these facilities are spread within the city, with easy access to main roads, with others as close as walking distance from the university. Both hotels and Airbnb can rate from as low as $20 for a bed and breakfast, and hostels that can be as low as $15 a night.

<h3>Food</h3>

Nairobi is a multicultural city, which makes it a hub of diverse culinary experiences, offering a range of options for foodies from local to international dishes. You can find these restaurants within the central business district or outside. Depending on your taste buds for the day, you will find the restaurant that fits.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='internet'>Internet</h2>

The venue provides you with reliable and convenient internet connectivity. However, we advise you to have a personal internet/data plan as backup plan in case of any glitches like in the case of not being within WiFi reach. You can easily purchase a new Safaricom (largest telecommunication provider) SIM card at the airport or any of their shop outlets in Nairobi town CBD. Safaricom offers you fast internet services and various data plans that start from as low as $5. You have the freedom to choose from other service providers such as Airtel and Telkom Kenya, who also offer good internet packages and data plans. The best practice is to download the mobile app for a given service provider from the google play store then proceed to purchase the desired data plan.

The SIM card you purchase will not only enable you to communicate, but also act as an e-wallet that allows you to make financial transactions across many shops, supermarkets, and pay for various services. You would be amazed at the digital literacy amongst Kenyans and how they have embraced technology that enables them to accept mobile based payments, and/or hard cash. You can also enjoy the convenience of online shopping by using mobile apps like Glovo and Jumia Online Shopping. Getting food and other essentials delivered to your door is also an option with available options from outlets like Foodplus, Naivas & Carrefour.

Moreover, you can also access online medical services through platforms like myDawa & Ponea health, which offer you quick access to professional consultation, drug dispensation and delivery with much ease.
