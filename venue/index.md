<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='kenya'>Kenya</h2>

Kenya is a vibrant and diverse East African nation with beautiful landscapes and rich cultures. The country, nestled on the equator, has amazing infrastructure, and its citizens are welcoming and friendly.

<h3>Languages</h3>

Kenya is a multi-ethnic State with a variety of languages spoken. English is the official language, while Kiswahili is the national and widely spoken language. In Nairobi, most people communicate in English and Swahili. A vast group of younger generations use slang commonly referred to as sheng, a mixture of various local dialects, including English and Swahili.

<h3>Time Zone</h3>

Kenya is within the East Africa Standard Time zone. It is three hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time (GMT +3).

<h3>Weather</h3>

Kenya enjoys a tropical climate that is pleasant, favourable, and characterised by plenty of sunshine all year round. In September, the temperature ranges from an average high of 24.6°C (76.3°F) to an average low of 14.2°C (57.6°F). The climate of inland cities, such as Nairobi, is temperate. It is recommended to prepare for dry and rainy days and to check the weather before travelling.


<h3 id='nairobi'>Nairobi</h3>

Nairobi is Kenya's capital and largest city, with an estimated population of 5,325,160 as of 2023. It serves as the country's economic, political, and cultural heart. The metropolis is located in the south-central part of Kenya and is the biggest city in Eastern Africa, making it a very ethnically and culturally diverse city where all the major ethnic tribes reside, besides Asians, Europeans, and expatriates. It also serves as the entry point to many African countries.

Nairobi is a hub for many international organisations and a gateway to some of Africa's most renowned national parks and wildlife reserves. The city has cultural attractions like museums, art galleries, and vibrant street markets. Visitors can savour a wide range of cuisines from both local and international food chains. Whether you are interested in history, wildlife, or shopping, Nairobi is the city.

The city has successfully hosted some major conferences, including Africa Climate Summit  (2023), UN Environment Assembly 5 (2022), RCMRD International Conference (2023), amongst many other regional and global events.

<h3>Taxi Services</h3>

Reliable Online and traditional cab/taxi operators are available within the city, offering reliable and affordable services. Payment can be made in local currency or using the known global currency. We recommend using online services via [Uber](https://www.uber.com/ke/en/) or the Kenyan service [Little Cab](https://www.little.bz/) while in Nairobi. And if your plane arrives a bit late, or you need to get to the airport at an odd hour, this option also allows for booking taxis: [PTG Travel](https://www.ptgtravels.com/). Lastly, most hotels also offer transit services that can be used for both airport transfers and movement around Nairobi. For security reasons, we advise that you **do not use** Bolt at this time.

Whereas tipping the taxi driver is customary for good service, it is not mandatory. Do not feel obligated, and neither should the taxi/cab driver force you to tip them.

Nairobi only has one toll road - the [Nairobi Expressway](https://nairobiexpressway.ke/nairobi-expressway-toll-rates) connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Westlands area. While it's a faster option with scenic views when coming and going to the airport, its costs are not included in your cab/taxi fees. Depending on your entry and exit points, this amount ranges from KES 170 to KES 500. The exact amount to be paid is displayed on a screen and can be paid by cash or mobile money.


<h3>Public Transport</h3>

Nairobi City has a diverse public transport system linking the Central Business District to several areas across the metropolitan area. Integrated with a few government-operated public transportation like trains and some bus companies, the public transport is dominated by ‘Matatus’ (basic 14-seater vans and 27-seater buses). Non-citizen guests are not recommended to use matatus unless they are accompanied by a local guide.

<h3>Motorbikes</h3>

In Nairobi, motorbikes, commonly referred to as 'boda-bodas,' are a popular and convenient mode of transportation. They can navigate through traffic more quickly than cars and are often used for quick trips around the city. If you would like to use a motorbike, It's important to exercise caution. Always use reputable services from ride-hailing apps like Uber that offer motorbike options and have safety measures in place. While convenient, please note that motorbike taxis may not be suitable for long distances or those with mobility challenges.

<h3>Telephone Services</h3>

Mobile telephone services are quite efficient in Kenya. Some of the leading providers are Safaricom, Airtel, and Telkom, which offer voice, data, messaging, mobile money services, and access to up to 5G internet coverage. 

While there will be WiFi coverage at the conference venue and in locations like hotels and malls, we recommend participants to purchase and register Safaricom SIM cards (available at the airport and malls) at approximately KES. 140(This does not include costs for a data bundle). 

<h3>Payments</h3>

Online payments (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, etc.) are accepted by most establishments in Kenya. We recommend requesting to tap your card and not allowing a service provider to walk away with it at any point.

<h3>Banking Services</h3>

Business hours are generally from 0830hrs to 1600hrs on weekdays and from 0830hrs to 1200hrs on Saturdays. The banks remain closed on Sundays and public holidays. Most banks have 24-hour Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) accepting international debit and credit cards. 

<h3>Foreign Exchange</h3>

Foreign currencies can be exchanged at the banks and Forex Bureaus. The currency of Kenya is the Shilling (KES) and is issued in 1000, 500, 200, 100 and 50 banknotes and 40, 20, 10, 5 and 1 coins. Currency exchange points are available at banks, the airport and at major malls & hotels. The daily prevailing exchange rate of major international currencies can be obtained from the [Central Bank of Kenya website]https://www.centralbank.go.ke/rates/forex-exchange-rates/). 

<h3>Business and Shopping Hours</h3>

Most businesses are generally open from 0800hrs to 1700hrs. However, some shopping malls operate 24 hrs. Guests who wish to shop may seek advice from their hotels on the nearest shopping facilities. Guests can also shop online as supermarkets such as Carrefour and Naivas allow for the same all days of the week with deliveries upto 10 PM.

<h3>Restaurants and Other Hotel Services</h3>

Considering the central location of the host institution, there is a wide range of accommodation services, including hotels, serviced apartments(Airbnbs), and shared hostels. We recommend guests stay in hotels as services are guaranteed and security is assured. In addition, kindly go through reviews on booking and social media platforms.

African, Western and Oriental cuisines are all available in Nairobi restaurants. Additionally, guests can also order from popular restaurants online via Uber Eats and Little Cab. When dining in Nairobi, leaving a tip is voluntary and considered courteous.

The local organising committee [has shared](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/welcome-to-nairobi_1097859) a recommended list of hotels and restaurants for consideration.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='healthcare'>Public Healthcare</h2>

Nairobi is generally considered low-risk for malaria, particularly within the city limits. However, it's always wise to take basic precautions, such as using insect repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing in the evenings, to minimise any risk of mosquito bites. Other health considerations include ensuring that routine vaccinations are up-to-date and practising good hygiene to prevent common illnesses. Should you experience any health issues or have concerns, the city’s public healthcare facilities are well-equipped to assist you. In case of health emergencies, we recommend visiting private health facilities which also accept comprehensive travel insurance covers. If one needs to purchase prescription medication, one can visit a pharmacy that are common across neighbourhoods and in malls. One can also place an order on [myDAWA](https://mydawa.com/) for delivery services.

Stay informed about any specific health advisories before travelling, and consult with your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your health during your stay.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='safety'>Personal Safety</h2>

While in Nairobi, please remain vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Avoid displaying valuable items and be cautious when using public transportation or walking alone, especially after dark—Utilise reputable taxi services or rideshare apps rather than hailing cabs from the street. Keep your belongings secure and be mindful of pickpockets in crowded areas. Avoid speaking with strangers and be cautious of unsolicited offers or assistance.

In an emergency, contact local authorities via 999 or 112 or our on-site support team immediately. 

LGBTQ+ community members are allowed to enter Kenya; still, it is vital to note that you may face unique challenges, and it is important to exercise discretion and awareness of local social norms. Kenyan law criminalises same-sex sexual activity; however, enforcement of the law is rare, but restrained behaviour in public is nonetheless advised. Nairobi has a more progressive outlook compared to other regions in the country, and there is a growing LGBTQ+ community and support organisations such as the National Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (NGLHRC) and Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya(GALCK+) within the city. The SotM committee also has a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination, harassment or any form of mistreatment; please reach out in case of any incidences.

<h3>Tourism</h3>

Kenya is a popular tourist destination throughout the year. Tourist attractions range from the white sandy beaches at the coast to scenic landscapes, memorable mountain expeditions and the majestic beauty of a wide variety of flora and fauna. Kindly visit [“48 Hours in Nairobi: A Short Guide to the Magical City For The Active Traveller”](https://tinyurl.com/NBOTourismGuide).

Most of the listed places can be accessed via a taxi; however, if you plan to visit a series of locations, we recommend booking with a local travel agency for easier facilitation. The month of September is also known for the great wildebeest migration in the savannah of the Maasai Mara, in case you might wish to spend a few more days in Kenya.


<h3>Food</h3>

Nairobi is a multicultural city, which makes it a hub of diverse culinary experiences, offering a range of options for foodies from local to international dishes. You can find these restaurants within the central business district or outside. Depending on your taste buds for the day, you will find the restaurant that fits.


<h2 class='space-bottom1' id='getting-to'>Getting to Nairobi</h2>

<h3>Flights</h3>

Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA)  is an international airport serving Nairobi and Africa’s premier hub and ideal gateway into and out of East and Central Africa. The airport is situated 18km from the central business district and is the largest and busiest aviation facility in East Africa. It is the hub of Kenya Airways, the national flag carrier, Jambojet, and serves over 40 passenger airlines, including Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM, Lufthansa, RwandAir. Alternative international aviation facilities are Kisumu International Airport, Eldoret International Airport, and Moi International Airport in Mombasa, with the rest spread across Kenyan regions.

Note that single-use plastic bags are prohibited in Kenya. If you
are travelling to Kenya, single use plastic bags will be confiscated at the airport. Please consider using alternative such as reusable bags instead.

<h3>Bus Travel Within East and Southern Africa</h3>

Road transport is commonly used within East African countries on a daily basis because of the good road infrastructure, security, and cost effectiveness. The recent infrastructural developments and easened custom borders process have made bus travelling easier in other neighbouring regions of south and central Africa.

<h2>Getting to Nairobi</h2>

<h3 class='space-bottom1' id='visa'>Visa</h3>

Beginning in January 2024, the Government of Kenya has introduced an electronic travel authorisation (eTA) requirement for all non-East African residents travelling into Kenya. This means that any traveller who is not a citizen/resident of the East African Partner States, i.e. Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda, must apply for the eTA if they intend to travel to Kenya. The eTA is also mandatory for travellers of any other nationality who previously enjoyed visa-free travel to Kenya, do not hold a Diplomatic or similar passport or possess Kenyan work permits. 

The application for the eTA is online only via the official Government of Kenya [eTA portal](https://www.etakenya.go.ke/en). It costs $34.

Travellers are required to apply for Kenya electronic travel authorisation (eTA) before departure. While it is indicated that it takes approximately 3 days to process your eTA, we recommend applying as soon as possible and at least 1 week before your travel date. 

If you would like to get an invitation letter from the conference organisation committee for your visa application process, please contact us at [sotm@openstreetmap.org](mailto:sotm@openstreetmap.org) with your details.

<h3>Vaccination</h3>

Travellers are responsible for complying with any travel measures stipulated by their country of departure, destination, and the respective airline.

If you are travelling from yellow fever-endemic countries, you are required to have valid vaccination certificates (vaccinated ten (10) days before your departure date).

We recommend participants to consult their medical practitioner for recommendations for other vaccinations and precautions that may apply to them.

<h3>Custom Regulations</h3>

* Drones and satellite equipment are restricted and require import permission from the Regulatory Authority, the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority. Unfortunately, this lengthy process requires additional support from a licenced entity in Kenya; we recommend working with local drone operators if needed.
* Single-use plastic bags are banned in Kenya. If you are travelling to Kenya, single-use plastic bags will be confiscated at the border and airport. Please consider using alternatives such as reusable bags instead.

<h3>Flights</h3>

Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) provides air connections to various airports worldwide. The airport is on the outskirts of the city. It takes around 35 minutes to reach the city centre by Cab/Taxi.

<h3>Bus Travel Within East and Soutern Africa</h3>

Road transport is commonly used across East African countries daily as a cost-effective option. Residents from Tanzania, Zanzibar, Uganda, and Rwanda can travel to Nairobi by bus. Here are some options that we recommend:

If travelling by bus, we also recommend:
* Travelling in groups; please check if other members from your OSM community are travelling by bus. 
* If possible, kindly book your travel so that you arrive a day or two before the conference as these are quite long and tiring journeys.
