<h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions for discussions about topics that well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. <!--We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2024/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of <em>online</em> self-organized sessions.--> For <em>on-site</em> self-organized sessions, we will set up a white board at the conference venue to reserve a time slot and room. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the conference's <a href="/codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a>.
